                Deer or true deer are hoofed ruminant mammals forming the
       family Cervidae. The two main groups of deer are the Cervinae, including
       the muntjac, the elk (wapiti), the red deer, the fallow deer, and the chital;
       and the Capreolinae, including the reindeer (caribou), the roe deer, the mule
       deer, and the moose.Female reindeer, and male deer of all species except the
       Chinese water deer, grow and shed new antlers each year. In this they differ
       from permanently horned antelope, which are part of a different family (Bovidae)
       within the same order of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla).</p>
